This code serves as a way to download cutout images from the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS), Legacy Survey 
(LegSurv DR9), and the PanSTARRS Sky Survey (PS1 (y/g/i)), given the coordinates of a particualar transient object, 
which in this case are the objects identified by the Zwicky Transient Facilities (ZTF) Bright Transient Survey (BTS). 
Moreover, the defined html pages represent a way to display, in a row for each ZTF object, the 3 VLASS Epoch images 
(VLASS1.1v2/VLASS1.2v2, VLASS2.1/VLASS2.2, VLASS3.1), and the two visual cutouts from LegSurv and PS1. As of writing 
this, all appears to be done and operational.
