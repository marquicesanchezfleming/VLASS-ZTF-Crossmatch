    m) largest_values_over_100.csv: Is the version of largest_values.csv that has only entries above -100
    n) smallest_values.csv_100: Is the version of smallest_values.csv that has only entries above -100

2)Images: Contains all the images from the project, including VLASS cutouts, Legacy Survey cutouts, and Pan-STARRS1
          cutouts

3)Scripts: Contains various mini-scripts that have been used to make the work flow better, they are;
    a) Comparing_Epoch_to_Difference.py: Generates the Difference_in_Days.csv file
    b) csv_dates_fixer.py: Turns the Difference_in_Days.csv into a csv with two columns
    c) Date and Time Converter.py: Converts an inputted mjd into utc
    d) Merging_Dates.py: Generates the merged_observations.csv
    e) Subtracting_Dates.py: Subtracts the dates in the Difference_in_Days.csv
    f) excluding_less_100.py: Inputs from the largest_values.csv and smallest_values.csv and only keeps the values
       greater than -100
    g) flux_rms_sorter.py: Alphabetically sorts the fixed_obs?.csv
    h) For_FRMS.py: Only outputs the peak flux and RMS to the VLASS_Observations.csv file, doesn't download images
    i) vlass_obs_cleaner.py: Inputs the VLASS_Observations.csv and alphabetically sorts it by epoch
    j) Presentation_Prep.py: Calculates the luminosity from a given redshift and peak flux, also generates histograms using
       data from the largest_values_over_100.csv and smallest_values_over_100.csv files

4) 1st_Cut_Material: Contains all the files relevant for the 1st cut, they are listed in order as should be ran;
    a) 1st_cut.py: Inputs the Fluxes_and_RMS.csv and outputs candidates with significance greater than 4
    b) Semi_Chosen_Ones.csv: Contains all the results from 1st_cut.py
    c) sigma_date_combiner.py: Inputs the Semi_Chosen_Ones.csv and Difference_in_days.csv to combine the two
    d) combined.csv: Contains all the Semi_Chosen_ones.csv inputs and their corresponding dates from Difference_in_days.csv
    e) filterer.py: Goes through the combined.csv and excludes epochs imaged before the explosion
    f) 1st_cut_candidates: A final list of candidate transients whom all have positive delta-times

5) 2nd_Cut_Material: Contains all the files relevant for the 2ndt cut, they are listed in order as should be ran;
    a) Significance_Calculator.py: Inputs the Fluxes_and_RMS.csv and outputs the significance between each epoch
    b) Calculated_Significances.csv: Contains a list of all transients and the statistical significance between its epochs
    c) 2nd_cut.py: Inputs the Calculated_Significances.csv and excludes significances less than 4
    d) 2nd_cut_candidates: Contains the confident transients with significanes greater than 4

6) HTML_Supplies: Contains all the files relevant for the HTML page
    a) Image_Populater.py: Populates and Generates the HTML page with the downloaded images
    b) please_work.html: The generated HTML page containing the images and the relevant information
    c) output.html: Contains the data from the please_work.html page
    d) styles.css: Contains the formatting for the HTML page

7) CSV: Is an alternate version of the VLASS_dyn_summary.php

8) VLASS_dyn_summary.php: Contains the tiles that correspond to a specific RA and Dec

9) VLASS Script.py: The main script that downloads all the cutouts, including VLASS cutouts, Legacy Survey cutouts,
                    and Pan-STARRS1 cutouts; also outputs peak flux and RMS and VLASS observations to their respective
                    csv's
